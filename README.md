# Election Data Visualization Project



## About the Data

I really enjoyed working with the data as politics is something I am deeply interested in. 
To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, I conducted a thorough data cleaning process, including verifying the data for any inaccuracies and removing duplicates. Additionally, I standardized the column names for consistency and clarity.

## Visualizations

Using the D3 library, I created several basic visualizations:

1. **Bar Chart**: Number of constituencies won by each party.
2. **Pie Chart**: Overall vote share by each party.
3. **Heatmap**: Vote shares by region for each party.

### Future Improvements

If I had more time, I would have enhanced the project with the following:
- **Additional Visualizations**: Incorporating other common visualizations and analyses done on elections, such as voter turnout maps, demographic breakdowns, and trend analyses over time. 
I tried to add a colored map of the result, however I was missing the geoson file to plot the mapp.
- **Improved Chart Designs**: Making the visualizations more interactive and visually appealing.
- **Comparison Charts**: Comparing the current election results with those from previous years.
- **Regional Analysis**: Detailed analysis of results by region.
- **Socio-Economic Factors**: Examining the impact of socio-economic factors on the election results and illustrating these comparisons with charts.

## Tools and Techniques

While my strongest visualization tool is PowerBI, which would have allowed me to create more sophisticated visualizations, I chose to use D3 for this project as it aligns with the job requirements. This experience has allowed me to demonstrate my versatility and willingness to adapt to different tools and technologies.

## Conclusion

I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to join The Times and The Sunday Times. I look forward to discussing my work and ideas further in an interview.
